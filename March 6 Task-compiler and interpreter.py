#Difference between compiler and interpreter
'''
Both compilers and interpreters are used to convert a program written in a
high-level language into machine code understood by computers.

Interperters:
1. reads the program line to line checking for errors, and runs the
    program simultaneously.

2. Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code.
    However, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.

3. Programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby use interpreters.

Compliers
1. It analyses the entire program and converts it into machine code.

2. Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code.
    However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.

3. Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.
